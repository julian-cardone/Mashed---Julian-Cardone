# JavaScript-Project---Julian-Cardone

Background:
This project is a broswer tool to mash up songs. The user may select one song from a list of instrumental audio tracks
and another song from a list of acappella audio tracks of popular songs. Once selected, the user may edit the tracks by 
their tempo, pitch, and other variables. The final product is an overlay of the two tracks, to create a 'mashup' of the two songs.
