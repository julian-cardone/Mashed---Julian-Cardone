# JavaScript-Project---Julian-Cardone

Background:
This project is a browser tool to mash up songs. The user may select one song from a list of instrumental audio tracks
and another song from a list of acappella audio tracks of popular songs. Once selected, the user may edit the tracks by 
tempo, pitch, and other variables. The final product is an overlay of the two tracks to create a 'mashup' of the two songs.

In Mashed, users will be able to:

- select from a list of popular songs, instrumental
