The user may select one song from a list of instrumental audio tracks and another song from a list of acappella audio tracks of popular songs. Once selected, the user may edit the tracks by  their tempo, pitch, and other variables. The final product is an overlay of the two tracks, to create a 'mashup' of the two songs.",
